# PHPFileMapper<br>
Place and run filemapper.php in any directory on your server to get a visual diagram of all nested files and directories. Or specify your own directory. Files are highlighted based on their file-type

<h2>Settings</h2>
<br>
<strong>$ignore_folders</strong> - An array containing names of folders you wish the script to ignore
<br><br>
<strong>$directory</strong> - Path for script to start in, default is "./" or the folder that the script is being ran from.

<br><br>

Note that due to the horizontal nature of the diagram. Large filesystems may be harder to read
